## The maximum log level of emitted messages (messages with a higher log level, i.e. less important ones, will be suppressed). Either one of (in order of decreasing importance) emerg, alert, crit, err, warning, notice, info, debug, or an integer in the range 0â€¦7. See syslog(3) for more information. This can be overridden with --log-level=
SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL="info"

## A boolean. If true, messages written to the tty will be colored according to priority. This can be overridden with --log-color=
SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR="true"

## A boolean. If true, console log messages will be prefixed with a timestamp. This can be overridden with --log-time=.
SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME="true"

## A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with a filename and line number in the source code where the message originates. This can be overridden with --log-location=.
SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION="true"

## A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with the current numerical thread ID (TID).
SYSTEMD_LOG_TID="true"

## The destination for log messages. One of console (log to the attached tty), console-prefixed (log to the attached tty but with prefixes encoding the log level and "facility", see syslog(3), kmsg (log to the kernel circular log buffer), journal (log to the journal), journal-or-kmsg (log to the journal if available, and to kmsg otherwise), auto (determine the appropriate log target automatically, the default), null (disable log output). This can be overridden with --log-target=.
SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET="auto"

## Controls where systemd looks for unit files and generators. These variables may contain a list of paths, separated by colons (":"). When set, if the list ends with an empty component ("...:"), this list is prepended to the usual set of paths. Otherwise, the specified list replaces the usual set of paths.
#SYSTEMD_UNIT_PATH="...:"
#SYSTEMD_GENERATOR_PATH="...:"
#SYSTEMD_ENVIRONMENT_GENERATOR_PATH="...:"

## Pager to use when --no-pager is not given; overrides $PAGER. If neither $SYSTEMD_PAGER nor $PAGER are set, a set of well-known pager implementations are tried in turn, including less(1) and more(1), until one is found. If no pager implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting this environment variable to an empty string or the value "cat" is equivalent to passing --no-pager.
## Note: if $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set, $SYSTEMD_PAGER (as well as $PAGER) will be silently ignored.
SYSTEMD_PAGER="less"

## Override the options passed to less (by default "FRSXMK"). Users might want to change two options in particular: K, X. See less(1) for more discussion.
SYSTEMD_LESS="FRSXMK"

## Override the charset passed to less (by default "utf-8", if the invoking terminal is determined to be UTF-8 compatible).
SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET="utf-8"

## Takes a boolean argument. When true, systemd and related utilities will use colors in their output, otherwise the output will be monochrome. Additionally, the variable can take one of the following special values: "16", "256" to restrict the use of colors to the base 16 or 256 ANSI colors, respectively. This can be specified to override the automatic decision based on $TERM and what the console is connected to.
SYSTEMD_COLORS="true"

## The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links should be generated in the output for terminal emulators supporting this. This can be specified to override the decision that systemd makes based on $TERM and other conditions.
SYSTEMD_URLIFY="true"
