# overwritten. Otherwise, the default value will always be appended.

# User file-creation mode mask (umask) sets permission for newly created files.
# The default is 022, only you can write data but anyone can read data. Values
# can be changed to reflect different permission settings. For example,
# umask=077 changes permission to be completely private, no other user can read
# or write data. To further specify permission, fmask (files) and dmask
# (directories) can also be used.

# What is DrvFs?
# DrvFs is a filesystem plugin to WSL that was designed to support interop
# between WSL and the Windows filesystem. DrvFs enables WSL to mount drives with
# supported file systems under /mnt, such as /mnt/c, /mnt/d, etc. For more
# information about specifying the default case sensitivity behavior when
# mounting Windows or Linux drives or directories, see the case sensitivity page.
